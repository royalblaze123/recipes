<h2>Notes</h2>
<div class="note-block">Pepper-and-mushroom chicken pizza matched with garlic wings finished with a measured, mild heat.

Portions (per person):

Frank: About 1/3 of the 12-inch pizza + 8 wings (about 4 oz cooked)

Susan: About 1/4 of the 12-inch pizza + 6 wings (about 3 oz cooked)

Elise: About 1/4 of the 12-inch pizza + 6 wings (about 3 oz cooked)

Tips (recipe-specific):

Keep the wing sauce light; tossing too heavily can soften the crisp skin.

If you prefer zero heat, skip the hot sauce and finish wings with extra lemon and smoked paprika.

For best crust, preheat the stone/steel the full 45 minutes.</div>
