<h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Heat the oven to 425°F (about 220°C). Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and lightly spray with olive oil.</li>

<li>Place the whole-wheat pizza crust on the prepared sheet pan. If using a very thin lavash-style crust, you can use two overlapping pieces to cover the pan; press them together slightly so they bake as one base.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, toss the bell peppers, broccoli florets, mushrooms, and red onion (if using) with 1 tsp olive oil and a light sprinkle of salt and pepper. Spread the vegetables on a second parchment-lined pan and pre-roast for 6–8 minutes, just until starting to soften.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, stir together the tomato sauce, garlic powder, dried Italian seasoning, and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Spread the seasoned tomato sauce evenly over the pizza crust, leaving a small border at the edges. Sprinkle half of the shredded mozzarella over the sauce.</li>
