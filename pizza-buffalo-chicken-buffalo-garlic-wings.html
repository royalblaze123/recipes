<h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Remove 1 dough ball from the refrigerator (or thawed vacuum-sealed dough) and keep covered at room temperature for 60–90 minutes so it relaxes.</li>
  <li>Preheat oven with a pizza steel or stone to 500°F for 45 minutes (or your oven’s maximum).</li>

  <li>Wings: Pat chicken wings very dry with paper towels. In a large bowl, toss wings with garlic powder, smoked paprika, onion powder, and black pepper until evenly coated.</li>
  <li>Cosori dual-basket setup: Split wings between both baskets in a single layer. Select Sync Cook at 380°F for 18 minutes. Shake/flip at the halfway reminder.</li>
  <li>Crisp finish: Increase to 400°F and cook 6–8 minutes more (shake once) until deeply browned and the thickest wing hits 165°F.</li>
  <li>Buffalo-garlic toss: In a large bowl, whisk hot sauce, olive oil, and juice from 1 lemon. Toss hot wings in the sauce until glossy.</li>
  <li>Pizza topping prep: Thin-slice red onion. Thin-slice celery. Shred or chop the cooked chicken into bite-size pieces.</li>
  <li>Stretch the dough ball into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Transfer to a floured peel or parchment.</li>
  <li>Spread a thin, even layer of pizza sauce over the dough. Sprinkle mozzarella evenly. Scatter chicken, red onion, and celery over the top. Drizzle 2 teaspoons hot sauce in a light zig-zag.</li>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<div class="note-block">Tomato-based buffalo chicken pizza served with crisp air-fried buffalo-garlic wings.

Portions (per person):

Frank: About 1/3 of the 12-inch pizza (about 3 slices if cut into 8) + 8 wings (about 4 oz cooked)

Susan: About 1/4 of the 12-inch pizza (about 2 slices if cut into 8) + 6 wings (about 3 oz cooked)

Elise: About 1/4 of the 12-inch pizza (about 2 slices if cut into 8) + 6 wings (about 3 oz cooked)

Tips (recipe-specific):

For lower sodium, use a no-salt-added pizza sauce and keep hot sauce measured.

If wings are crowded, run two quick batches; single-layer wings crisp far better than stacked wings.

If the dough keeps shrinking back, rest it covered for 10 minutes and stretch again.</div>
