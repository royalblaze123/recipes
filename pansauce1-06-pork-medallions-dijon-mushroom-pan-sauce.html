<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Portions (per person):</p>
<p>Frank – 1 plate (8 oz cooked protein, 2 cups cauliflower rice, 1 1/2 cups cabbage, ~3 tbsp pan sauce).<br><br>Susan – 1 plate (6 oz cooked protein, 3/4 of Frank’s starch portion, 1 1/4 cups cabbage, ~2 tbsp pan sauce).<br><br>Elise – 1 plate (6 oz cooked protein, 3/4 of Frank’s starch portion, 1 1/4 cups cabbage, ~2 tbsp pan sauce).</p>

  <li>Cool promptly; store in airtight containers in the fridge up to 3–4 days (typical safety guidance).</li>
  <li>Reheat protein + vegetables in a skillet with a splash of broth (best for sauces) or air fry at 350°F for 4–6 minutes; microwave starch 60–90 seconds with a splash of water.</li>
