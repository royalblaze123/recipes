  <h1>Garlic Rosemary Salmon with Root Veggie Sheet Pan</h1>
  <p>NOTES: Full salmon dinner built as a single-pan or bowl-style meal with cardiometabolic-friendly fats, smart carbs, and plenty of non-starchy vegetables. Salmon is roasted or baked at moderate heat to protect omega-3s while keeping saturated fat very low. Seasonings are kept moderate-sodium and PPPD-friendly.<br><br>PORTION SIZES (serves 3 total): Frank gets the largest portion (≈1/3 of the total meal); Susan and Elise each receive slightly smaller portions (≈1/4 of the total meal each). Frank = 1.0×; Susan = 0.75×; Elise = 0.75× portions.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 salmon fillets (about 4–5 oz each), skin-on or skinless</li>
    <li>8 oz carrots, cut into 1/2-inch coins, and 8 oz parsnips, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
    <li>1 red onion, cut into wedges</li>
    <li>1–2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil (divided, as described)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt (or to taste, keeping sodium moderate)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>Marinade: 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 2 cloves minced garlic, and 1 tsp dried rosemary</li>
    <li>To finish: fresh parsley</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a large rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels and set aside in the refrigerator while you prep the vegetables.</li>
    <li>Prep the starch: 8 oz carrots, cut into 1/2-inch coins, and 8 oz parsnips, cut into 1/2-inch pieces — cut into 1/2-inch pieces if not already bite-size. Place the potatoes or other starch on the prepared sheet pan. Drizzle with about 1 tablespoon olive oil, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Spread in a single layer. Roast for 10–15 minutes, stirring once, until just starting to soften but not fully tender.</li>
    <li>While the starch starts roasting, prep the vegetables: 1 red onion, cut into wedges — cut into bite-size pieces as needed. Set the vegetables in a large mixing bowl.</li>
    <li>Make the marinade: In a small bowl, whisk together the ingredients for the marinade (1 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 2 cloves minced garlic, and 1 tsp dried rosemary). Taste and adjust with a splash more lemon or herbs if desired. Spoon 1–2 tablespoons of the marinade over the vegetables in the bowl and toss to coat.</li>
    <li>Remove the sheet pan from the oven. Push the par-roasted starch toward one half or the edges of the pan to make room. Spread the marinated vegetables in a single layer in the open space on the pan.</li>
    <li>Place the salmon fillets skin-side down (if using skin-on) on top of the vegetables or in an open space on the pan. Brush the tops of the salmon generously with the remaining marinade, making sure each fillet is well coated.</li>
    <li>Return the sheet pan to the oven and roast for 12–15 minutes, depending on thickness, until the salmon flakes easily with a fork and reaches 125–130°F in the center, the vegetables are tender-crisp, and the potatoes are fully tender with lightly browned edges.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and finish with fresh parsley. Taste a vegetable and potato and add a small pinch of extra salt or pepper only if needed.</li>
    <li>To serve, divide the potatoes/starch and vegetables among three plates. Top each plate with a salmon fillet, giving Frank the largest portion of starch and vegetables and Susan and Elise slightly smaller portions. Serve immediately.</li>
