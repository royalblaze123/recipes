  <h1>Ghost Pepper Extreme Wings (Cosori Air Fryer)</h1>
  <p>
    NOTES: Cooked in a Cosori dual-basket air fryer using Sync Cook and the shake reminder. Designed to be spicy but not brutally hot—PPPD- and GERD-awareness in mind. Use as an occasional higher-fat protein meal and pair with a big veggie side and light-carb starch. PORTION SIZES: Frank: largest portion (about 8–9 wing pieces); Susan: medium portion (about 6–7 pieces); Elise: medium portion (about 6–7 pieces).
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2.5 lb chicken wing sections (drumettes and flats), patted very dry with paper towels</li>
<li>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>3/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
<li>1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1.5 tsp smoked paprika</li>
<li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
<li>1/4–1/2 tsp ground ghost pepper powder (very hot, adjust to tolerance)</li>
<li>Nonstick spray for air fryer baskets (avocado or olive oil spray)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pat the chicken wing sections very dry with paper towels. Trim any excess visible skin or large fat deposits to lean them out slightly.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the kosher salt, black pepper, and all listed dry spices. Stir to make an even spice blend.</li>
<li>Add the chicken wings to the bowl. Drizzle with the olive oil and toss thoroughly until every piece is lightly coated with oil.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the spice blend evenly over the wings, tossing as you go so all sides are coated. If using a wet ingredient (like hot sauce), add it now and toss again until the wings are glossy and evenly seasoned.</li>
<li>Preheat your Cosori dual-basket air fryer to 390°F for 3–5 minutes. While it preheats, lightly spray both air fryer baskets with nonstick spray.</li>
<li>Divide the wings evenly between the two baskets in a single layer, leaving a little space between pieces so air can circulate. Avoid stacking the wings.</li>
<li>Set the Cosori to 390°F for 22 minutes using Sync Cook so both baskets run with the same settings. Turn on the shake reminder.</li>
<li>When the shake reminder beeps (around the 10–12 minute mark), pull out both baskets. Use tongs to flip and shuffle the wings so browned sides rotate. Slide baskets back in and resume cooking.</li>
<li>At 22 minutes, check a few of the largest wings with an instant-read thermometer—internal temperature should be at least 165°F in the thickest part, not touching bone.</li>
<li>If the wings are not yet browned or crispy enough, cook for an additional 3–5 minutes at 390°F, checking every 2 minutes until they are golden, blistered in spots, and fully cooked through.</li>
<li>Transfer the hot wings to a clean bowl. If the recipe calls for a final toss (extra hot sauce or finishing spice), add it now and toss quickly to coat.</li>
<li>Let the wings rest for 3–5 minutes to allow juices to redistribute and the surface to set slightly, which helps keep the skin crisp.</li>
<li>Portion wings into three servings: a slightly larger pile for Frank and two slightly smaller but equal piles for Susan and Elise. Serve immediately with your preferred veggie side and a simple starch if desired.</li>
