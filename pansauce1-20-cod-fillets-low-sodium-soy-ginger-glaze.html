<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Portions (per person):</p>
<p>Frank – 1 plate (8 oz cooked protein, 1 cup cooked brown rice, 1 1/2 cups cabbage, ~3 tbsp pan sauce).<br><br>Susan – 1 plate (6 oz cooked protein, 3/4 of Frank’s starch portion, 1 1/4 cups cabbage, ~2 tbsp pan sauce).<br><br>Elise – 1 plate (6 oz cooked protein, 3/4 of Frank’s starch portion, 1 1/4 cups cabbage, ~2 tbsp pan sauce).</p>
