<h2>Notes</h2>
<div class="note-block">Tomato-based chicken and broccoli pizza with ricotta dollops, served with garlic-parmesan wings.

Portions (per person):

Frank: About 1/3 of the 12-inch pizza + 8 wings (about 4 oz cooked)

Susan: About 1/4 of the 12-inch pizza + 6 wings (about 3 oz cooked)

Elise: About 1/4 of the 12-inch pizza + 6 wings (about 3 oz cooked)

Tips (recipe-specific):

Microwaving broccoli briefly keeps it tender-crisp and prevents watery pizza.

Ricotta adds creaminess without needing any yogurt-based sauce.

Use parmesan as a measured finishing flavor on wings so sodium stays predictable.</div>
