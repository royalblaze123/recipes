<h2>Recipe</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the air fryer to 390°F for 3–5 minutes with the empty basket in place so it is hot when you add the food.</li>
  <li>Scrub 1.25 lb baby potatoes and cut them into 3/4-inch chunks. Add the potatoes to a large bowl and toss with 3 tsp olive oil, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp salt substitute until all pieces are evenly coated.</li>
  <li>Spread the seasoned potatoes in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Air fry at 390°F for 12–14 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through, until the edges are browned and the potatoes are just fork-tender. Transfer potatoes to a warm bowl and cover loosely with foil.</li>
  <li>While the potatoes cook, microwave 1 bag frozen asparagus spears and 1/2 bag frozen bell pepper strips together in a covered microwave-safe dish until just tender-crisp, following package timing as a guide. Drain off any excess liquid and set the vegetables aside for serving.</li>
  <li>Rinse 1.5 lb cod fillets under cold water and pat them very dry with paper towels. Cut the cod into 3 similar portions so each person gets one piece and all pieces are similar in thickness.</li>
  <li>In a small bowl, whisk together 4 tsp olive oil, 2 tsp bottled lemon juice, 2 tsp minced garlic, 2 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp salt substitute, and 1 tsp black pepper to make a thick spice rub.</li>
  <li>Place the dried cod portions on a plate or tray. Spoon the spice rub over all sides of the fish and gently press it in so it forms a light coating without breaking the fillets. Let the cod rest in the seasoning for about 5 minutes while you prepare the basket.</li>
  <li>Return the warm potatoes to one side of the air fryer basket in a loose single layer. Arrange the seasoned cod portions on the other side of the basket, leaving a little space between fillets for air circulation. If your basket is small, cook the cod in two batches and keep finished pieces warm under foil.</li>
  <li>Air fry cod and potatoes together at 390°F for 8–10 minutes, depending on thickness, turning the potatoes once halfway through. The cod is done when the thickest piece flakes easily with a fork and reaches 130–135°F in the center. Do not overcook or the fish will dry out.</li>
  <li>Right before serving, quickly rewarm the asparagus and peppers in the microwave for 30–60 seconds if needed. Build plates: Frank gets about 8 oz cooked cod, 1 cup roasted potatoes, and 1 1/4 cups mixed asparagus and peppers; Susan and Elise each get about 5.5 oz cooked cod, 3/4 cup potatoes, and 1 cup mixed vegetables.</li>
