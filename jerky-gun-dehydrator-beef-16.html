      <h1>Jerky Gun Dehydrator Beef – Honey Mustard Heat</h1>
      <div class="meta">RBM • Jerky Gun + Dehydrator • Ground Beef • Published 2025-12-19</div>

      <h2>Ingredients (purchase-clean)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 lb 93% lean ground beef</li>
<li>6 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>6 tsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
<li>6 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
<li>2 tsp apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>4 tsp garlic powder</li>
<li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
<li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
<li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
<li>2 tsp honey</li>
<li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Food safety (do not skip): Preheat your dehydrator to 160°F. Ground meat jerky is higher risk than whole-muscle jerky—use a thermometer and ensure the jerky reaches 160°F at the start or immediately after drying.</li>
<li>1) In a large bowl, add: 2 lb 93% lean ground beef plus all seasonings/sauces listed in Ingredients. Mix by hand for 2–3 minutes until tacky and very uniform.</li>
<li>2) Cover and refrigerate the meat mixture for 30 minutes (improves bind and makes the jerky gun extrude cleaner).</li>
<li>3) Load the jerky gun. Extrude strips onto dehydrator trays lined with mesh sheets. Target thickness: about 1/8 inch and consistent end-to-end. Leave 1/4 inch space between strips.</li>
<li>4) Optional safety step (recommended if your dehydrator struggles to hold 160°F): Arrange strips on a foil-lined sheet and bake at 275°F until the thickest strip hits 160°F internal (typically ~8–12 minutes). Return strips to dehydrator trays.</li>
<li>5) Dehydrate at 160°F for 3.5–6 hours (time varies by thickness and dehydrator). Rotate trays top-to-bottom every 90 minutes.</li>
<li>6) At the 2-hour mark, blot strip surfaces with paper towels to remove fat/moisture and speed drying.</li>
<li>7) Start checking at 3.5 hours. Jerky is done when it is dry, bends, and cracks but does not snap in half. It should not feel soft or spongy in the center.</li>
<li>8) Cool strips on a rack for 30 minutes. Package immediately in zip bags or vacuum bags. Refrigerate for best quality; use within 1–2 weeks, or freeze for longer storage.</li>
      </ol>

Portions (per person):

Frank: 4 oz jerky

Susan: 3 oz jerky

Elise: 3 oz jerky

Tips (recipe-specific):

Honey-mustard tang with a back-end kick.

Keep honey measured; it’s just a flavor cue, not a glaze.

      <p class="small">Reminder: USDA recommends heating meat to 160°F for safe jerky preparation.</p>
