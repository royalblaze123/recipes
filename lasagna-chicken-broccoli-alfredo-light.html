<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly coat a 9×9-inch baking dish with nonstick spray.</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the whole-wheat lasagna noodles until just shy of al dente, about 7–8 minutes. Drain and lay flat on parchment to prevent sticking.</li>

<li>Slowly whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Cook 2–3 minutes, whisking constantly, until the sauce begins to thicken.</li>
<li>Reduce the heat to low. Whisk in the Greek yogurt, dried thyme, dried basil, black pepper, grated nutmeg, and optional salt. Warm gently without boiling until smooth.</li>
<li>Fold the shredded chicken and steamed broccoli into the yogurt sauce and remove the pan from the heat.</li>
<li>Spread a thin layer of the chicken and broccoli sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish.</li>
<li>Layer lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by more chicken and broccoli sauce, then a light sprinkle of shredded mozzarella.</li>
<li>Repeat the layers (noodles, sauce, mozzarella) until all components are used, finishing with sauce and cheese on top.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the grated Parmesan over the final layer.</li>
<li>Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 10–15 minutes until bubbling and lightly golden.</li>
