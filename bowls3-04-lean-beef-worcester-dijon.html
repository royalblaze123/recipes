</ul>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2.0 lb lean beef steak (top sirloin or top round), trimmed</li>
  <li>1 can canned black beans</li>
  <li>24 oz mushrooms</li>
  <li>1 pack microgreens</li>

  <li>2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
  <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Black beans: Rinse and drain the can well. Warm with 1/2 cup water in a saucepan 4–5 minutes; keep warm.</li>
  <li>Vegetables: Roast per steps below to get browned edges (texture contrast matters).</li>
  <li>Mushrooms: Slice. Toss with 4 tsp olive oil + 2 tsp minced garlic + 1 tsp pepper + 1 tsp salt substitute. Roast at 425°F for 14–16 minutes, stirring once, until browned.</li>
  <li>Lean beef: Slice across the grain into strips. Sear in a hot skillet with 3 tsp olive oil in 2 batches, 2–3 minutes per batch to brown.</li>
  <li>Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk the Sauce ingredients (worcester dijon). Keep it measured—this is a finish, not a flood.</li>
  <li>Build bowls (assembly order): Add warm starch first, then vegetables, then sliced protein. Spoon sauce on top. Finish with microgreens after heat (they’re the ‘gourmet’ signal).</li>
  <li>Plate portions per Notes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Portions (per person):</p>
<p>Frank – 1 bowl (8 oz cooked protein, 1/2 cup black beans, 1 1/2 cups mushrooms, 1/2 cup microgreens, 2–3 tbsp sauce).<br><br>Susan – 1 bowl (6 oz cooked protein, 3/4 of Frank’s starch portion, 1 1/4 cups mushrooms, 1/3 cup microgreens, 2 tbsp sauce).<br><br>Elise – 1 bowl (6 oz cooked protein, 3/4 of Frank’s starch portion, 1 1/4 cups mushrooms, 1/3 cup microgreens, 2 tbsp sauce).</p>
<p><strong>Tips (recipe-specific):</strong></p>
<p>Build order matters: warm base → dry veg → protein → sauce → microgreens last so nothing turns soggy.<br><br>Keep sauce measured; the bowl should taste ‘finished,’ not ‘dressed.’</p>

<h2>Storage + Reheat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cool promptly; store components in airtight containers in the fridge up to 3–4 days (typical safety guidance).</li>
  <li>Reheat grain/beans + protein 60–90 seconds in the microwave; reheat roasted veg 4–6 minutes at 350°F in the air fryer for texture; add sauce and microgreens after reheating.</li>
</ul>
