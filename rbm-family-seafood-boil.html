  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <div class="notes"><strong>Portions:</strong>
Frank (1.0×): Build a full plate with potatoes, corn, sausage, clams, mussels, scallops, and shrimp.
Susan (0.75×): Potatoes + corn + sausage; seafood optional.
Elise (0.75×): Potatoes + corn + sausage; seafood optional.

<strong>Tips:</strong>
For shrimp texture: chop cooked shrimp into bite-size pieces and toss in the butter finish; serve in a separate bowl so shrimp-sensitive eaters can skip it.
For less “fishy” aroma: keep shrimp and scallops in the pot only for the stated time; remove shrimp immediately and do not let seafood sit in hot liquid.</div>
