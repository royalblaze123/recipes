<h2>Notes</h2>
<div class="note-block">Mild taco-seasoned turkey pizza with a bright chipotle-lime wing finish (flavor-forward, not overly spicy).

Portions (per person):

Frank: About 1/3 of the 12-inch pizza + 8 wings (about 4 oz cooked)

Susan: About 1/4 of the 12-inch pizza + 6 wings (about 3 oz cooked)

Elise: About 1/4 of the 12-inch pizza + 6 wings (about 3 oz cooked)

Tips (recipe-specific):

Keep salsa as a thin layer; too much liquid can soften the crust.

Use chipotle powder as a measured finish so the heat stays mild and predictable.

If you want extra crunch, add shredded lettuce after baking instead of baking it on the pizza.</div>
