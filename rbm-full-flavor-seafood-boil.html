  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <div class="notes"><strong>Portions:</strong>
Frank (1.0×): 1/3 of the finished boil.
Susan (0.75×): 1/4 of the finished boil.
Elise (0.75×): 1/4 of the finished boil.

<strong>Tips:</strong>
This is labeled “Full-Flavor / Occasional” because Cajun seasoning + sausage + Old Bay typically push sodium higher than a health-goal version.
Discard any clams or mussels that do not open after cooking.
For best texture, keep the pot at a gentle boil once shellfish go in and follow the timing—shrimp and scallops overcook quickly.</div>
