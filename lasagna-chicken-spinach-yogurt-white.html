<li>2 cups baby spinach, chopped</li>
<li>1 small yellow onion, finely diced</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
<li>1 cup plain 2% Greek yogurt</li>
<li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
<li>1/2 tsp dried thyme</li>
<li>1/2 tsp dried basil</li>
<li>1/4 tsp grated nutmeg</li>
<li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
<li>1/4 tsp kosher salt (optional, to taste)</li>
<li>1 cup part-skim shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>1/4 cup grated reduced-fat Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-step Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly coat a 9×9-inch baking dish with olive oil or nonstick spray.</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the whole-wheat lasagna noodles until just shy of al dente, about 7–8 minutes. Drain and lay the noodles flat on parchment to prevent sticking.</li>
<li>Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté 4–5 minutes until softened.</li>
<li>Add the minced garlic and cook 30–60 seconds, stirring frequently, until fragrant but not browned.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, whisk the cornstarch with 1/4 cup of the chicken broth until smooth. Pour the remaining chicken broth into the saucepan with the onions and garlic and bring to a gentle simmer.</li>
<li>Slowly whisk the cornstarch mixture into the simmering broth. Cook 2–3 minutes, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened.</li>
<li>Reduce the heat to low. Whisk in the plain Greek yogurt, dried thyme, dried basil, grated nutmeg, black pepper, and optional salt. Warm gently for 1–2 minutes without boiling, until the sauce is smooth and creamy.</li>
<li>Fold the shredded chicken breast into the warm yogurt sauce and remove the pan from the heat.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, toss the chopped spinach with half of the shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
<li>Spread a thin layer of the chicken yogurt sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish.</li>
<li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Add a layer of the chicken yogurt mixture, then sprinkle over a layer of the spinach and mozzarella mixture.</li>
<li>Repeat the layers (noodles, chicken yogurt mixture, spinach and mozzarella) until all components are used, finishing with a layer of sauce on top.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese and all of the grated Parmesan evenly over the top.</li>
<li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 10–15 minutes, until bubbling and lightly golden on top.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven and let the lasagna rest for at least 10 minutes to set. Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley before serving.</li>
<li>Cut the lasagna into 4 equal squares. Serve 2 squares to Frank and 1 square each to Susan and Elise, alongside a simple green salad or steamed vegetables.</li>
