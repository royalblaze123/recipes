<li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
<li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
<li>1/2 tsp dried rosemary, crushed</li>
<li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
<li>1/4 tsp kosher salt (optional, to taste)</li>

<li>1 cup part-skim shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>2 tbsp grated reduced-fat Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>2 tbsp fresh basil, chopped</li>

<h2>Step-by-step Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C). Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Arrange the sliced red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, carrot, and red onion on the sheet pan. Drizzle with half of the olive oil and toss to coat. Roast for 15–20 minutes, stirring once, until the vegetables are lightly browned and tender.</li>
<li>While the vegetables roast, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the whole-wheat lasagna noodles until just shy of al dente, about 7–8 minutes. Drain and lay flat on parchment to prevent sticking.</li>
<li>Heat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the lean ground turkey and cook 6–8 minutes, breaking it into small crumbles, until browned and cooked through.</li>
<li>Stir in the minced garlic and cook 30–60 seconds until fragrant.</li>
<li>Add the dried oregano, dried basil, dried rosemary, black pepper, and optional salt to the turkey. Toast the herbs with the meat for 1–2 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
<li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes and low-sodium chicken broth. Stir well, reduce heat to low, and simmer 8–10 minutes until slightly thickened.</li>
<li>Remove the roasted vegetables from the oven and chop them into bite-size pieces. Fold the roasted vegetables into the turkey tomato sauce.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, stir the ricotta until smooth.</li>
<li>Lightly coat a 9×9-inch baking dish with nonstick spray. Spread a thin layer of the turkey and roasted vegetable sauce over the bottom.</li>
<li>Layer lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by a layer of ricotta, then more turkey and roasted vegetable sauce.</li>
<li>Repeat the layers (noodles, ricotta, sauce) until you have used all the components, finishing with sauce on top.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan evenly over the top layer.</li>
<li>Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 10–15 minutes until bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
<li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and rest for 10–15 minutes to set. Sprinkle with chopped fresh basil before serving.</li>
<li>Cut the lasagna into 4 equal squares. Serve 2 squares to Frank and 1 square each to Susan and Elise, adding a side of steamed green vegetables if desired.</li>
