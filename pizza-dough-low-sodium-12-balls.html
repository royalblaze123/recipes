<h2>Notes</h2>
<div class="note-block">Low-sodium pizza dough designed to keep room for toppings while yielding 12 dough balls; each ball bakes into one 12-inch pizza crust.

Portions (per person):

Frank – 1 dough ball makes 1 12-inch pizza crust.

Susan – 1 dough ball makes 1 12-inch pizza crust.

Elise – 1 dough ball makes 1 12-inch pizza crust.

Tips (recipe-specific):

This dough uses 2 tsp salt for the full batch (about 390 mg sodium per 12-inch crust), so your sauce/cheese/toppings can carry the rest of the sodium budget.

Best flavor comes from a cold ferment: refrigerate dough balls 24–72 hours before baking.

Freezing: freeze dough balls after they are chilled/firm. Best quality 4–8 weeks; still workable up to ~3 months. Thaw 12–24 hours in the fridge, then warm on the counter before stretching.

Vacuum sealer: chill 30–60 minutes first, then seal on a gentle/pulse setting so the dough is snug but not crushed; double-seal. Do not vacuum-seal dough that is actively proofing at room temperature.</div>
