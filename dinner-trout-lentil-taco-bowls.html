<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Portions (per person):</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Frank</strong> – About 2 1/2 cups lentil-bean base topped with a larger trout portion and a light yogurt drizzle (about 40% of the full recipe).</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Susan</strong> – About 2 cups base topped with a smaller trout portion and a light yogurt drizzle (about 30% of the full recipe).</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Tips (recipe-specific):</strong></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Keep the seasoning mild in the base; add extra heat at the table to stay PPPD/GERD-friendly.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Don’t over-simmer lentils—pull them when just tender so the bowl stays chunky.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>If sodium is a concern, rinse beans thoroughly and rely on lime + cumin for flavor.</p>
