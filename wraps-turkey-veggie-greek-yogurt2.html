<h2>Servings</h2>
<p>3 servings.</p>
<h2>Times</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prep time: 15 minutes</li>
<li>Cook time: 0 minutes (no cooking required)</li>
<li>Total time: 15 minutes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 large high-fiber whole-wheat tortilla</li>
<li>2 medium high-fiber whole-wheat tortillas</li>
<li>4 slices deli turkey</li>
<li>1 3/4 oz part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>6 tbsp 2% plain Greek yogurt</li>
<li>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 romaine heart</li>
<li>1/2 cup cucumber rounds</li>
<li>6 tbsp tomato</li>
<li>1/4 medium avocado</li>
<li>3/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
<li>3/4 tsp dried oregano</li>
<li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
<li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
<li>1/8 to 1/4 tsp kosher</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
<ol><li>Ask deli for turkey sliced thin for sandwiches (not shaved). Chop the romaine and measure out 1 1/2 cup for the recipe. Refrigerate remaining romaine.</li>
<li>Rinse and pat dry the romaine lettuce, cucumber, and tomato. Shred the romaine, slice the cucumber into thin rounds, and dice the tomato (remove seeds to keep wraps from getting soggy). Thinly slice the avocado and set everything aside.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt, olive oil, garlic powder, dried oregano, smoked paprika, black pepper, and a small pinch of salt until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning with a tiny bit more salt or pepper if needed. This is your spread for all three wraps.</li>
<li>Briefly warm each tortilla in a dry skillet over low heat for 15–20 seconds per side, or microwave for about 10 seconds, just until pliable. Keep them covered with a clean towel so they stay soft while you assemble.</li>
<li>Place the large (10-inch) tortilla on a cutting board. Spread about 2 tbsp of the Greek-yogurt dressing over the center, leaving a 1–2 inch border. Layer about 4.5 oz sliced turkey over the dressing, then top with about 3/4 oz shredded part-skim mozzarella, a generous handful of shredded romaine, several cucumber slices, a spoonful of diced tomato, and a few thin slices of avocado.</li>
<li>Fold the sides of the large tortilla in toward the center, then roll the tortilla up tightly from the bottom into a burrito-style wrap. If packing to go, wrap tightly in foil or parchment and slice in half on the diagonal just before eating.</li>
<li>Place one medium (8-inch) tortilla on the board. Spread about 2 tbsp of dressing down the center. Add about 3 oz sliced turkey, 1/2 oz shredded mozzarella, a moderate handful of shredded romaine, cucumber slices, a spoonful of diced tomato, and a few thin slices of avocado.</li>
<li>Fold in the sides of the medium tortilla and roll up firmly from the bottom. Wrap in foil or parchment for grab-and-go, and slice in half if desired.</li>
<li>Repeat the same process with the remaining medium (8-inch) tortilla, using about 2 tbsp dressing, 3 oz sliced turkey, 1/2 oz shredded mozzarella, shredded romaine, cucumber, tomato, and avocado slices.</li>
<li>Serve the wraps immediately for best texture, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours. For meal prep or work lunches, keep the wraps snugly wrapped in foil or parchment and store in a container in the fridge until ready to take to work.</li>
