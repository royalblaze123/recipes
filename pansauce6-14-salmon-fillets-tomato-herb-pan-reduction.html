<h2>Times</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Prep time: 18 minutes</li>
  <li>Cook time: 22 minutes</li>
  <li>Total time: 40 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1.75 lb salmon fillets</li>
  <li>1.0 cup dry brown rice</li>
  <li>1 bag frozen broccoli florets</li>
  <li>1 lb carrots</li>
  <li>9 tsp olive oil</li>
  <li>4 tsp minced garlic</li>

  <li>2 tsp dried parsley</li>
  <li>5 tsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>3 tsp vinegar</li>
  <li>2 tsp cornstarch</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Base: Cook 1 cup dry brown rice to yield ~3 cups cooked. Keep warm.</li>
  <li>Skillet: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Brown is flavor. Pale is regret.</li>
  <li>Protein: Pat fish dry. Sear in a lightly oiled skillet 3–4 minutes per side (or bake at 425°F: cod 10–12 min; salmon 10–13 min). Transfer.</li>
  <li>Vegetables (Broccoli + Carrots): Cook vegetables with 3 tsp olive oil 6–10 minutes until browned-tender. Add 2 tsp minced garlic for last 60 seconds; transfer to a plate.</li>
  <li>Pan sauce: Reduce heat to medium. Add 1/2 cup water to the hot pan and scrape up browned bits. Whisk in sauce ingredients (including cornstarch). Simmer 2–4 minutes until lightly thickened and glossy.</li>
  <li>Finish: Return protein to pan; spoon sauce over. Add parsley + black pepper at the end.</li>
  <li>Plate: Base first, then vegetables, then protein; drizzle sauce last. Portions per Notes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Portions (per person):</p>
<p>Frank – 1 plate (7 oz cooked fish, 1 cup cooked brown rice, 2 cups vegetables, 2–3 tbsp pan sauce).<br><br>Susan – 1 plate (5 1/4 oz cooked fish, 3/4 of Frank’s base portion, 1 1/2 cups vegetables, 2 tbsp pan sauce).<br><br>Elise – 1 plate (5 1/4 oz cooked fish, 3/4 of Frank’s base portion, 1 1/2 cups vegetables, 2 tbsp pan sauce).</p>
<p><strong>Tips (recipe-specific):</strong></p>
<p>Deglaze while the pan is hot and the fond is still loose—cold pan deglaze is a pointless ritual.<br><br>Keep the sauce as a glaze-level finish: enough to coat, not enough to turn dinner into soup.</p>

<h2>Storage + Reheat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cool promptly; store protein + veg + base in airtight containers in the fridge up to 3–4 days (typical safety guidance).</li>
  <li>Reheat base + protein 60–90 seconds; reheat veg 4–6 minutes at 350°F in the air fryer for texture. Warm sauce briefly or spoon on after reheating.</li>
</ul>
