<h2>Times</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Prep time: 20 minutes</li>
  <li>Cook time: 25 minutes</li>
  <li>Total time: 45 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2.0 lb chicken breast</li>
  <li>2 bags frozen cauliflower rice</li>
  <li>2 bunches asparagus</li>
  <li>24 oz mushrooms</li>
  <li>9 tsp olive oil</li>

  <li>7 tsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
  <li>3 tsp vinegar</li>
  <li>2 tsp cornstarch</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Base: Sauté cauliflower rice 6–7 minutes until hot and steam-dry. Keep warm.</li>
  <li>Skillet: Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. You want sizzle, not sadness.</li>
  <li>Vegetables: Add 3 tsp olive oil to a large skillet over medium-high. Add vegetables; cook 6–10 minutes until tender-crisp with browned edges. Add 2 tsp minced garlic for the last 60 seconds.</li>
  <li>Protein: Slice lean meat across the grain into strips. Sear in 2 batches with 3 tsp olive oil 2–3 minutes per batch to brown; transfer.</li>
  <li>Glaze slurry: Whisk glaze ingredients (including cornstarch) with 1/2 cup water until smooth.</li>
  <li>Reduce & glaze: Return protein + veg to the skillet. Pour in slurry. Cook 2–4 minutes, stirring, until glossy and the sauce clings to everything.</li>
  <li>Finish: Reduce 2–4 minutes until it clings. This is the point.</li>
  <li>Plate portions per Notes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Portions (per person):</p>
<p>Frank – 1 plate (8 oz cooked protein, 2 cups cauliflower rice, 2 cups vegetables, 3–4 tbsp glaze).<br><br>Susan – 1 plate (6 oz cooked protein, 3/4 of Frank’s base portion, 1 1/2 cups vegetables, 3 tbsp glaze).<br><br>Elise – 1 plate (6 oz cooked protein, 3/4 of Frank’s base portion, 1 1/2 cups vegetables, 3 tbsp glaze).</p>
<p><strong>Tips (recipe-specific):</strong></p>
<p>The whole point is reduction: 2–4 minutes at the end until it clings. If it’s watery, you stopped early.<br><br>Cook vegetables hot and fast for browning; steam-soft veg kills the ‘gourmet’ vibe instantly.</p>

<h2>Storage + Reheat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cool promptly; store in airtight containers in the fridge up to 3–4 days (typical safety guidance).</li>
  <li>Reheat in a skillet with 1–2 tbsp water to re-gloss the glaze, or microwave 60–90 seconds; add any fresh finish (zest/herbs) after reheating.</li>
</ul>
