<h2>Recipe</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the air fryer to 380°F for 3–5 minutes with the empty basket in place so it is hot when you add the food.</li>
  <li>Scrub 1.25 lb baby potatoes and cut them into 3/4-inch chunks. Add the potatoes to a large bowl and toss with 3 tsp olive oil, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp salt substitute until evenly coated.</li>
  <li>Spread the seasoned potatoes in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Air fry at 380°F for 12–14 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through, until the edges are browned and the potatoes are just tender. Transfer potatoes to a warm bowl and cover loosely with foil.</li>
  <li>While the potatoes cook, cut 1 head broccoli into small florets and rinse. Microwave the florets in a covered microwave-safe dish with a splash of water for 3–4 minutes until crisp-tender, then drain well. Set aside for serving.</li>
  <li>Measure out 1 cup whole wheat panko breadcrumbs from the bag and add them to a large mixing bowl. Add 1.5 lb lean ground turkey, 2 tsp minced garlic, 2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt substitute, 1 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp bottled lemon juice, and 3 tsp olive oil.</li>
  <li>Use clean hands to gently mix the turkey and seasonings just until everything is evenly combined; avoid overworking the mixture so the meatballs stay tender.</li>
  <li>Divide the turkey mixture into 10 equal portions and roll each portion into a firm, round meatball. Lightly wet your hands with water or a drop of olive oil as needed so the mixture does not stick.</li>
  <li>Lightly spray or brush the preheated air fryer basket with a small amount of olive oil if it tends to stick. Arrange the meatballs in a single layer in the basket with a little space between each one; cook in two batches if your basket is small so they are not crowded.</li>
  <li>Air fry the turkey meatballs at 380°F for 10–12 minutes, turning once halfway through, until the centers reach 165°F on an instant-read thermometer and the outsides are nicely browned. If cooking in two batches, keep finished meatballs warm on a plate loosely tented with foil.</li>
  <li>Right before serving, rewarm the potatoes and broccoli if needed. Build plates: Frank gets 4 meatballs (about 8 oz cooked turkey), 1 1/4 cups potatoes, and 1 1/4 cups broccoli; Susan and Elise each get 3 meatballs (about 6 oz cooked turkey), 1 cup potatoes, and 1 cup broccoli.</li>
