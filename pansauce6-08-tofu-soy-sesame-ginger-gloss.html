<h1>Pan-Sauce Tofu with Cabbage + Mushrooms over Cauliflower Rice</h1>

<h2>Servings</h2>
<p>3 plates (Frank 1.0×, Susan 0.75×, Elise 0.75×).</p>

<h2>Times</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Prep time: 18 minutes</li>
  <li>Cook time: 22 minutes</li>
  <li>Total time: 40 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 blocks firm tofu</li>
  <li>2 bags frozen cauliflower rice</li>
  <li>1 head green cabbage</li>
  <li>24 oz mushrooms</li>
  <li>9 tsp olive oil</li>
  <li>4 tsp minced garlic</li>
  <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
  <li>2 tsp salt substitute</li>
  <li>2 tsp dried parsley</li>
  <li>6 tsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
  <li>2 tsp sesame oil</li>
  <li>2 tsp cornstarch</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Base: Sauté cauliflower rice 6–7 minutes until hot and steam-dry. Keep warm.</li>
  <li>Skillet: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Brown is flavor. Pale is regret.</li>
  <li>Protein: Press tofu 15 minutes, cube. Sear in a nonstick skillet with 3 tsp olive oil 8–10 minutes until browned edges; transfer.</li>
  <li>Vegetables (Cabbage + Mushrooms): Cook vegetables with 3 tsp olive oil 6–10 minutes until browned-tender. Add 2 tsp minced garlic for last 60 seconds; transfer to a plate.</li>
  <li>Pan sauce: Reduce heat to medium. Add 1/2 cup water to the hot pan and scrape up browned bits. Whisk in sauce ingredients (including cornstarch). Simmer 2–4 minutes until lightly thickened and glossy.</li>
  <li>Finish: Return protein to pan; spoon sauce over. Add parsley + black pepper at the end.</li>
  <li>Plate: Base first, then vegetables, then protein; drizzle sauce last. Portions per Notes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Portions (per person):</p>
<p>Frank – 1 plate (12 oz cooked tofu, 2 cups cauliflower rice, 2 cups vegetables, 2–3 tbsp pan sauce).<br><br>Susan – 1 plate (9 oz cooked tofu, 3/4 of Frank’s base portion, 1 1/2 cups vegetables, 2 tbsp pan sauce).<br><br>Elise – 1 plate (9 oz cooked tofu, 3/4 of Frank’s base portion, 1 1/2 cups vegetables, 2 tbsp pan sauce).</p>
<p><strong>Tips (recipe-specific):</strong></p>
<p>Deglaze while the pan is hot and the fond is still loose—cold pan deglaze is a pointless ritual.<br><br>Keep the sauce as a glaze-level finish: enough to coat, not enough to turn dinner into soup.</p>

<h2>Storage + Reheat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cool promptly; store protein + veg + base in airtight containers in the fridge up to 3–4 days (typical safety guidance).</li>
  <li>Reheat base + protein 60–90 seconds; reheat veg 4–6 minutes at 350°F in the air fryer for texture. Warm sauce briefly or spoon on after reheating.</li>
</ul>
