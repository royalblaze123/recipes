<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Frank – 1 plate (8 oz cooked protein, 2 cups cauliflower rice, 1 1/2 cups mushrooms, ~3 tbsp pan sauce).<br><br>Susan – 1 plate (6 oz cooked protein, 3/4 of Frank’s starch portion, 1 1/4 cups mushrooms, ~2 tbsp pan sauce).<br><br>Elise – 1 plate (6 oz cooked protein, 3/4 of Frank’s starch portion, 1 1/4 cups mushrooms, ~2 tbsp pan sauce).</p>
