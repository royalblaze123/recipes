<ol>
  <li>Base: Rinse 1 cup dry quinoa. Cook with 2 cups water to yield ~3 cups cooked. Fluff and keep warm.</li>

<p>Frank – 1 plate (8 oz cooked protein, 1 cup cooked quinoa, 2 cups vegetables, 3–4 tbsp glaze).<br><br>Susan – 1 plate (6 oz cooked protein, 3/4 of Frank’s base portion, 1 1/2 cups vegetables, 3 tbsp glaze).<br><br>Elise – 1 plate (6 oz cooked protein, 3/4 of Frank’s base portion, 1 1/2 cups vegetables, 3 tbsp glaze).</p>
