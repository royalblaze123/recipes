<li>1 small yellow onion, finely diced</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

<li>2 cups baby spinach, chopped</li>
<li>2 cups no-salt-added crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>1/2 cup no-salt-added tomato sauce</li>
<li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
<li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
<li>1/2 tsp dried thyme</li>
<li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
<li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
<li>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 cup part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
<li>1 cup part-skim shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>2 tbsp grated reduced-fat Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
<li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for mild heat)</li>
<li>1/4 tsp kosher salt (optional, to taste)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-step Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly coat a 9×9-inch baking dish with olive oil or nonstick spray.</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the whole-wheat lasagna noodles until just shy of al dente, about 7–8 minutes. Drain and lay flat on a sheet of parchment to prevent sticking.</li>
<li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and red bell pepper and sauté 4–5 minutes until softened.</li>
<li>Stir in the minced garlic and cook 30–60 seconds until fragrant, stirring constantly so it does not burn.</li>
<li>Add the lean ground turkey to the skillet. Cook, breaking it into small crumbles, for 6–8 minutes until browned and fully cooked through.</li>
<li>Stir in the dried oregano, dried basil, dried thyme, smoked paprika, black pepper, and optional red pepper flakes. Toast the spices with the turkey for 1–2 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
<li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce. Stir to combine, reduce heat to low, and simmer 8–10 minutes to let the flavors develop. Taste and add a small pinch of kosher salt only if needed.</li>
<li>Fold the chopped baby spinach into the hot sauce and cook 1–2 minutes until just wilted. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chopped fresh parsley.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, combine the part-skim ricotta cheese and 2 tablespoons of the shredded mozzarella cheese. Stir until smooth.</li>
<li>Spread a thin layer of the turkey tomato sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish.</li>
<li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread one-third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then spoon over a layer of the turkey sauce.</li>
<li>Repeat the layers (noodles, ricotta mixture, turkey sauce) until you have used all the noodles and fillings, finishing with a layer of sauce on top.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese and the grated Parmesan evenly over the top layer of sauce.</li>
<li>Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 10–15 minutes, until the cheese is melted and lightly browned and the sauce is bubbling around the edges.</li>
<li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and rest for at least 10–15 minutes to set. This makes it easier to cut clean portions.</li>
<li>Cut the lasagna into 4 equal squares. Serve 2 squares to Frank and 1 square each to Susan and Elise, pairing with a side salad or steamed non-starchy vegetables to complete the meal.</li>
