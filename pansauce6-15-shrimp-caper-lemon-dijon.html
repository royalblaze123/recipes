  <li>Protein: Pat shrimp dry. Sear in a hot skillet with 3 tsp olive oil 2–3 minutes per side until pink; transfer.</li>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Portions (per person):</p>
<p>Frank – 1 plate (7 oz cooked shrimp, 1 cup roasted sweet potatoes, 2 cups vegetables, 2–3 tbsp pan sauce).<br><br>Susan – 1 plate (5 1/4 oz cooked shrimp, 3/4 of Frank’s base portion, 1 1/2 cups vegetables, 2 tbsp pan sauce).<br><br>Elise – 1 plate (5 1/4 oz cooked shrimp, 3/4 of Frank’s base portion, 1 1/2 cups vegetables, 2 tbsp pan sauce).</p>
<p><strong>Tips (recipe-specific):</strong></p>
<p>Deglaze while the pan is hot and the fond is still loose—cold pan deglaze is a pointless ritual.<br><br>Keep the sauce as a glaze-level finish: enough to coat, not enough to turn dinner into soup.</p>

<h2>Storage + Reheat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cool promptly; store protein + veg + base in airtight containers in the fridge up to 3–4 days (typical safety guidance).</li>
  <li>Reheat base + protein 60–90 seconds; reheat veg 4–6 minutes at 350°F in the air fryer for texture. Warm sauce briefly or spoon on after reheating.</li>
</ul>
